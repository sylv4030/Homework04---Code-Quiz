# Homework04---Code-Quiz
Code quiz homework

I started this project by working on starting the game with a start button that would first start a timer. I found one way of doing this on youtube but evenutally our instructor covered it in class using an interval, clear interval, etc and it was much cleaner

I used alerts and prompts for ending the game and telling the score and asking for initials, I would like to go back to learn how to have this be a fillable field on the page that is uhidden after the game ends.

The hardest part for me was figuring out how to start cycling through the questions array and show this on the page. I read through a lot of examples to finally understand how to do this using the variables and inner.html

Creating the answer confirming function was fun and used a lot of the same info I learned in researching the question asking function.
